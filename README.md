These functions will process a spacy nlp document, compiling lists of tuples: (word, freq).

<h1>Usage:</h1>

<p>Generate a list based on the specific word forms</p>

<ul>
<li><code>foo = word_form_freq(bar)</code>
<p>Where 'bar' is the name of the spacy nlp document</p>
</ul>

<p>Generate a list based on the lemmata</p>

<ul>
<li>
<li><code>foo = word_form_freq(bar)</code>
<p>Where 'bar' is the name of the spacy nlp document</p>
</ul>

<p>Generate a dictionary organized by lemma, sorted by frequency including word forms

<ul>
<li>
<li><code>foo = lemma_and_form(bar)</code>
<p>Where 'bar' is the name of the spacy nlp document</p>
</ul>
